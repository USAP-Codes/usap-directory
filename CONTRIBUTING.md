# Introduction

Welcome!

If you're reading this, you're probably considering contributing to the USAP Directory project. We thank you for your interest and appreciate folks like you because your efforts move the project forward!

Developing software is relatively easy when the team is small but becomes increasingly complex as the team size grows. These guidelines formalize the way we work. Following them enables more developers to participate and makes managing the project easier for the development leads.

We welcome any contributions to this project. Some of the ways in which you can contribute is by improving our documentation, tackling open issues, submitting bugs or suggesting features.

# Ground Rules

To learn more about the expected behavior in our community please see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution

The best way to get started with the project is by looking through issues labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.

If you have never contributed to open source before please read this [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

# Getting started

## How To Submit A Contribution

1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. Complete the changes in your fork.
3. Test your changes.
3. Open a pull request.

Instructions on setting up and running the project on your local machine can be found in the [README](README.md) file.

# How to report a bug

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email team@placeholder.com instead.

Examples of security issues:
* I have access to something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to.
* I can disable something for other people.
* If you are unsure whether you've encountered a security issue, just email us at team@placeholder.com.

## Filing Bug Reports

If you encounter an bug in the project, please open an issue. Make sure to include the following information:

* What did you do to trigger this issue?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

The USAP Directory is a platform to strengthen the USAP network and enable our alumni to connect and foster relationships.

We welcome all suggestions or ideas on how we improve this application. The best way to communicate your ideas with the team is by creating an issue that describes the feature you would like to see. Please make sure to include why it's needed and how it should work.

# Code review process

* All changes made to this repository must be reviewed before being merged.

* The development leads will review the Pull Requests regularly and you can expect feedback within a week.

* If further action is required after feedback is given, you'll be expected to respond within two weeks. If there is no activity within that period we will likely close the pull request.

# Community

If you have questions, you can contact either of the development leads below. We also welcome USAP Alumni to join the core team or participate as contributors.

## Development Leads

* Tendai Mudyiwa ([@tendaitt](https://github.com/tendaitt))
* Felix Gondwe ([@felixgondwe](https://github.com/felixgondwe))

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions
We use the following conventions to streamline the contributions we receive.

## Preferred style for code

### Python

[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### JavaScript

[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Commit message conventions

1. Specify the type of commit in the subject e.g. `FIX`, `FEAT`, `TEST`, `REFACTOR` or `DOCS`.
2. Your commit subject line should not exceed 50 characters.
3. Capitalize your subject line.
4. Use an imperative tone in commit messages.

In most cases the commit subject line will suffice to describe the changes. If you have to add a commit message body, please focus on explaining the `what` and `why` of your changes instead of the `how`.

Examples:
> FEAT: Search by name

> TEST: Update unit tests for search functionality

## Pull Requests

All pull requests should reference the issue being addressed.

## Issue Labeling

If you open an issue, please add a label. If you are unsure of the appropriate label, add the `Miscellaneous` label. The development leads will later review the issues and assign the appropriate label.
